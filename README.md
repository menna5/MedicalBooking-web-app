# MedicalBooking
## web application.
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: It's a simple web application made using flask, html and CSS. The idea of it is booking an appointment with a doctor.

#### **First for the view**
There is a welcome page with a place to log in or register for creating an account
Then the user will be set for the booking page and the navbar above have the other options
*Log out* get you back to welcome page
*Appointments* get you a table of the appointments you made before
*Inquiries* get you a form you can leave your email address and name and write any question or feedback about the doctor or the place


#### **Secod the components of the code**
 For flask, it uses MVC design pattern, *Model* *View* *Controller*

 The model is the database we use, I used three tables
 users, appointments and inquiries
 The first one for collecting users data and appintments for their appointments' data and inquiries collects the data they leave so the team can analyse it later
 

 The controller is the code that controls the app and link all of this together


 The View is the html and CSS stuff, I explained it better above as the view
